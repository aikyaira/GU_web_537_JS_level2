If&nbsp;the Salmon was raised in&nbsp;the wild, the color will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;brighter or&nbsp;more rosy pink than a&nbsp;farm raised Salmon. Wild Salmon most often have a&nbsp;more delicate flavor that is&nbsp;rich and buttery tasting. Although the wild Salmon will typically contain more oil than farm raised Salmon, the fish is&nbsp;more full flavored than farmed Salmon which will have a&nbsp;tendency to&nbsp;provide a&nbsp;more &laquo;fishy&raquo; or&nbsp;&laquo;fatty&raquo; flavor.",

People come together several times during the season to&nbsp;boil pounds of&nbsp;the buggers and eat &rsquo;em alongside cooked potatoes, corn, garlic&mdash;and sometimes Andouille sausage or&nbsp;other vegetables. The spoils are dumped directly from the boiling pot onto long tables covered in&nbsp;plastic tablecloths and newspapers. Plates are not (or&nbsp;are rarely) used. Dozens of&nbsp;rolls of&nbsp;paper towels are placed around the table and serve as&nbsp;napkins. (They are all used.) People eat with their hands, not forks. And when the spoils are devoured, another pot is&nbsp;dumped, again and again and again.",
